StyleSpectrum is an intelligent, AI-driven personal color analysis system designed to help users discover the colors that best complement their natural features. 
Built with a combination of image processing techniques and interactive interface design, the tool analyzes a user’s facial image to detect their skin undertone
and assign them to the most accurate seasonal color category within the 12-season color theory framework. By doing so, it removes the guesswork from choosing 
suitable colors and provides a professional-level analysis that is easy to use, accessible, and visually engaging.

The system extracts the dominant skin tone using techniques such as CLAHE for lighting normalization, ROI identification,
and K-Means clustering for accurate color extraction. Once the key skin color values are determined, the tool compares them against 
a predefined dataset of seasonal palettes using Euclidean distance to find the closest match. This ensures that the user receives a
scientifically aligned seasonal palette—whether they belong to Light Spring, Deep Autumn, Cool Winter, or any of the other subcategories.

One of the standout features of StyleSpectrum is its real-time virtual try-on module. Users can immediately visualize how various palette colors
appear on their skin through an interactive interface that overlays selected colors onto their image. 
This instant feedback not only enhances the user experience but also builds confidence in choosing outfits, makeup, accessories, or hair colors that enhance their natural appearance.

Beyond analysis, StyleSpectrum connects users with personalized outfit suggestions drawn from curated datasets. 
Each set of recommendations is aligned with both the user’s season and their preferred gender-based styling preferences, making it a complete digital styling assistant.
